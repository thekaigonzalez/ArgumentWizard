## Style Guide

| Rule                               | Explanation                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistent Naming**              | Use CamelCase for function names and snake_case for variables consistently throughout the code.     |
| **Indentation**                    | Use a consistent indentation style, such as four spaces or one tab, to improve code readability.    |
| **Comments**                       | Add comments to explain complex sections, functions, or structures to enhance code documentation. |
| **Spacing**                        | Maintain consistent spacing around operators and after commas to improve code readability.         |
| **Braces Placement**               | Choose a consistent style for placing braces, either on the same line or the next line after control statements. |
| **Error Handling**                 | Implement consistent error-handling mechanisms throughout the code for better code robustness.    |
| **Conditional Statements**         | Ensure that conditional statements and loops have a clear structure, using indentation to highlight the block structure. |
| **Avoid Magic Numbers**             | Replace magic numbers with named constants or macros to improve code readability and maintainability. |
| **Use of `self`**                  | Consider using a more standard term like `parser` instead of `self` for the argument representing the instance of the structure. |
| **Avoid Direct Access to Struct Members** | Encapsulate the internal details of the `wArgParser` structure, providing functions or macros for data access or manipulation. |
